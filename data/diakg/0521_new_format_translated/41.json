      "paragraph_en": "(3) Glucocorticoids: Mainly used for patients with severe acute gout accompanied by severe systemic symptoms, who are ineffective or limited in treatment with colchicine and NSAIDs, and patients with renal insufficiency. When systemically administered, oral prednisone 0.5 mg·kg-1.d-1 is used continuously for 5 to 10 days and then discontinued, or 0.5 mg·kg-1d-1 is used for 2 to 5 days and then gradually reduced, with a total course of 7 to 10 days. When oral medication is not suitable, intravenous glucocorticoids can be considered. When using glucocorticoids, attention should be paid to preventing and treating adverse reactions such as hypertension, diabetes, water and sodium retention, and infection, and avoiding the use of long-acting preparations. For patients with acute attacks involving only 1 to 2 large joints and poor response to systemic treatment, intra-articular injection of short-acting glucocorticoids can be considered to avoid repeated use in a short period of time."

HUA patients have renal tubular dysfunction, such as increased nocturia, low specific gravity urine, and small molecular weight proteins, indicating the presence of chronic urate nephropathy.

Patients at high risk should receive active intravenous fluid replacement, and urine output should be maintained at 80~100ml·m-2·h-1 if heart and kidney function permits. Recombinant uricase or xanthine oxidase inhibitors are preferred to control blood uric acid below 300μmol/L; patients with confirmed acute uric acid nephropathy need emergency treatment, and renal function is expected to return to normal with timely and effective treatment. Treatment measures include: ① Strict low-purine diet. ② Hydration therapy: In the absence of contraindications, daily fluid intake should reach 3000ml to maintain urine output at 80~100ml·m-2·h-1. ③ Uric acid-lowering drugs: Select according to the pre-treatment uric acid level and/or the risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Allopurinol can be used for patients with blood uric acid <480μmol/L before treatment, no severe renal impairment, and only a moderate to low risk of tumor lysis syndrome, while uricase is recommended for patients with elevated blood aciduria levels before treatment. There is little clinical data on Febuxostat, so it should only be used with caution in patients who are not suitable or cannot use uricase or allopurinol. ④Hemodialysis treatment when necessary."

Recent studies have shown that the use of nutritional meal replacement methods can take into account both weight loss and nutritional balance. Wadden et al. conducted a follow-up analysis of the Look AHEAD study (involving 5145 patients with obesity and diabetes), which examined the weight loss of patients who received dietary support and education and enhanced lifestyle intervention. Enhanced lifestyle intervention, while educating patients on a balanced nutritional model, also provides nutritional meal replacement as a support measure. In general, enhanced lifestyle intervention combined with nutritional meal replacement can reduce patients' weight more effectively than dietary support and education alone (37.7% of beneficiaries in the enhanced lifestyle intervention group achieved the goal of 10% weight loss at the end of the first year of intervention, while only 3.3% of patients in the dietary support and education group achieved this goal)."

Noakes et al. confirmed that obese people who adopted a high-protein diet lost more weight than those who adopted a high-carbohydrate diet (6.4 kg vs. 3.4 kg, P=0.035). When the subjects were allowed to have a daily energy intake of 20 kcal/kg, protein accounted for 30% of the total energy, carbohydrates accounted for 45%, and fat accounted for 25%, and vitamins and potassium were supplemented at the same time, the weight was significantly reduced after 12 weeks (4.72±4.09) kg, and BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) also decreased by (1.87±1.57) kg/m2, (3.73±2.91) cm and (0.017±0.029), respectively. Layman et al. randomly divided healthy obese adults into a high-protein, low-carbohydrate group (PRO group) and a low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet group (CHO group). After 4 months, there was no significant difference in the amount of weight loss between the two groups, but the body fat (body fat) content of the PRO group decreased more significantly; compared with the CHO group, the PRO group had more significant improvements in triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the serum of obese people, and had higher compliance. A 2-year experiment compared the weight loss effects of high-protein and high-carbohydrate diets in overweight people with diabetes. The results suggest that a high-protein diet may be helpful for patients at risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. After 4 weeks of weight loss treatment with a very low-energy diet, 113 moderately obese patients lost 5% to 10% of their body weight, and then used a high-protein diet (18%) and a normal protein diet (15%) for 6 months to maintain their weight. The results showed that the high-protein diet had a lower weight rebound rate."

The results of two well-designed large-sample randomized controlled trials showed that in the short-term follow-up (within 24 months), the weight regain in the mutual assistance technology intervention group was significantly lower than that in the self-control group. A meta-analysis of 5 studies found that Internet intervention had the same effect as face-to-face intervention, and high website utilization was positively correlated with weight loss maintenance."

A case-control study showed that the serum vitamin B12 level in obese children was 400 ng/L, which was significantly lower than that in children of normal weight (530 ng/L); compared with children of normal weight, after adjusting for confounding factors such as gender and age, the odds ratio (OR) of low serum vitamin B12 in obese children was as high as 4.33. Other studies have found that obese children have lower levels of Zn, Se, and Fe in their serum, but higher levels of serum Cu; serum Zn levels are significantly negatively correlated with serum total cholesterol levels, but positively correlated with serum HDL-C levels. The negative correlation between vitamin D levels and childhood obesity has also been further confirmed."

Women lost an average of 1.3 kg per week, and men lost 2.1 kg per week. Most patients were able to accept the regimen without any serious side effects. A study based on 16 obese patients showed that after 8 weeks of alternate-day fasting intervention, the average weight of the patients decreased by (5.6±1.0) kg, the average waist circumference decreased by 4.0 cm, the body fat content decreased from the original (45±2)% to (42±2)%, the systolic blood pressure decreased from (124±5) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) to (116±3) mmHg, and the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations also decreased by (21±4)%, (25±10)% and (32±6)%, respectively, while the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level did not change. Johnson et al. also found that after 8 weeks of alternate-day fasting intervention, the BMI of obese patients decreased by 8% compared with the baseline value, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides decreased by 10% and 40%, respectively. A study based on 115 obese women published in 2013 showed that after 3 months of intervention, the average weight loss of obese patients using the two-day fasting method was 4kg, while the average weight loss of obese patients using traditional energy restriction was 2.4kg, and the former had more obvious improvement in insulin resistance. A 2014 meta-analysis on the prevention of type 2 diabetes found that intermittent fasting can effectively reduce weight and prevent type 2 diabetes, and improves metabolic markers such as blood sugar, insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight and obese patients."

{"id":"Q001","input":"What are the most common symptoms associated with Type 2 diabetes?","target":"Common symptoms include polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased hunger), fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing wounds.","metadata":{"category":"Symptom_Disease","difficulty":"easy"}}
{"id":"Q002","input":"Which laboratory tests are typically used to diagnose diabetes, and what do they measure?","target":"Key diagnostic tests include: (1) Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) — measures fasting blood glucose; (2) Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) — measures glucose response after 2 hours; (3) HbA1c — measures average blood glucose over 2–3 months; and (4) Random Plasma Glucose — measures glucose at any time in symptomatic patients.","metadata":{"category":"Test_Disease","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q003","input":"What are the first-line pharmacological treatments used for Type 2 diabetes, and how do they work?","target":"Metformin is the first-line drug; it reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity. GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors may also be recommended early, particularly for patients with cardiovascular or renal risk.","metadata":{"category":"Drug_Disease","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q004","input":"What adverse drug effects are commonly associated with metformin therapy?","target":"Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and metallic taste. Rarely, metformin can cause vitamin B12 deficiency or lactic acidosis in high-risk patients.","metadata":{"category":"ADE_Drug","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q005","input":"How does insulin resistance develop in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes?","target":"Insulin resistance develops due to impaired insulin signaling in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, often driven by obesity, chronic inflammation, and excess free fatty acids. This leads to decreased glucose uptake and increased hepatic glucose production.","metadata":{"category":"Pathogenesis_Disease","difficulty":"hard"}}
{"id":"Q006","input":"Which anatomical organs are most affected by long-term complications of diabetes?","target":"Chronic diabetes most commonly affects the kidneys (diabetic nephropathy), eyes (retinopathy), nerves (neuropathy), heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), and lower limbs (risk of foot ulcers).","metadata":{"category":"Anatomy_Disease","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q007","input":"45 year old on canagliflozin presents with genital mycotic infection. Adjust drug?","target":"Treat infection topically; can continue SGLT2 if tolerated.","metadata":{"category":"drug‑therapy","difficulty":"easy"}}
{"id":"Q008","input":"32 year old man with 3 month history of polyuria, 6 kg weight loss, fasting glucose 8.9 mmol L, A1c 7.4 percent, BMI 22. No ketones. Is this likely type 1 or type 2 diabetes?","target":"Lean adult with acute weight loss suggests autoimmune type 1; confirm with pancreatic antibodies and start insulin.","metadata":{"category":"diagnosis","difficulty":"easy"}}
{"id":"Q009","input":"Patient on dapagliflozin and ketogenic diet presents with nausea, glucose 9 mmol L, ketones 4 mmol L. Concern?","target":"Euglycaemic DKA; stop SGLT2 and treat as DKA urgently.","metadata":{"category":"safety","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q010","input":"CKD stage 4 on insulin and linagliptin develops symptomatic hypoglycaemia. Likely cause?","target":"Reduced insulin clearance in CKD necessitates dose cut.","metadata":{"category":"comorbidity","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q011","input":"55 year old with T2D asks about alcohol. Safe weekly limit?","target":"Up to 14 UK units spread over week with food and glucose monitoring.","metadata":{"category":"lifestyle","difficulty":"easy"}}
{"id":"Q012","input":"T2D, BMI 36, follows low carb diet <50 g day; morning ketones 0.4 mmol L, glucose 5‑6. Safe to continue?","target":"Yes; nutritional ketosis <1.0 mmol L is acceptable if euglycaemic.","metadata":{"category":"lifestyle","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q013","input":"T2D on basal‑bolus insulin, BMI 41, A1c 10. Would adding tirzepatide allow insulin de‑escalation?","target":"Yes; GLP‑1 GIP co‑agonist can reduce insulin need and weight.","metadata":{"category":"drug‑therapy","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q014","input":"Patient on gliclazide develops repeated morning hypos despite bedtime snack. Best adjustment?","target":"Reduce evening gliclazide dose or switch to once‑daily morning dosing.","metadata":{"category":"drug‑therapy","difficulty":"easy"}}
{"id":"Q015","input":"Pregnant woman with T1D in first trimester, using insulin pump. Basal 40 percent TDD. Is this proportion appropriate?","target":"Yes; basal 40‑50 % of total daily dose is typical in pregnancy.","metadata":{"category":"drug‑therapy","difficulty":"easy"}}
{"id":"Q016","input":"Adolescent T1D with coeliac disease struggles with glycaemic swings. Dietary tip?","target":"Use certified gluten‑free low‑GI grains like quinoa.","metadata":{"category":"comorbidity","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q017","input":"72 year old man with T2D, eGFR 42, A1c 8.1 on metformin 1 g bid. Consider SGLT2 inhibitor?","target":"Yes; start dapagliflozin or empagliflozin as eGFR above 30 improves renal and CV outcomes.","metadata":{"category":"drug‑therapy","difficulty":"medium"}}
{"id":"Q018","input":"58-year-old woman with long-standing T2D, diabetic neuropathy, recurrent UTIs, BMI 33, eGFR 65, A1c 9.2% on maximally tolerated metformin and basal insulin. Is adding a GLP-1 RA preferred over intensifying prandial insulin?","target":"Yes; add a GLP-1 RA (e.g., semaglutide or dulaglutide) as it provides superior A1c reduction, weight loss, and lower hypoglycemia risk vs. prandial insulin, while avoiding worsening UTI risk compared to SGLT2 inhibitors.","metadata":{"category":"drug-therapy","difficulty":"hard"}}
{"id":"Q019","input":"44-year-old man with T1D using hybrid closed-loop pump reports frequent post-prandial hyperglycemia despite appropriate basal rates. Sensor data shows rapid glucose spikes after high-fat meals. What is the optimal adjustment strategy?","target":"Use extended or dual-wave bolus dosing; high-fat meals delay gastric emptying and cause late glucose rises, so delivering part of the bolus up front and part over 1–3 hours improves post-prandial control.","metadata":{"category":"insulin-strategy","difficulty":"hard"}}
{"id":"Q020","input":"70-year-old man with T2D, HFpEF, CKD stage 3b (eGFR 34), albuminuria 580 mg/day, and A1c 7.1% on metformin 500 mg bid and linagliptin. BP well controlled. Should finerenone be initiated?","target":"Yes; finerenone is indicated for T2D with CKD and persistent albuminuria despite optimized standard care. eGFR >25 makes him eligible, and benefits include reduced CKD progression and CV events.","metadata":{"category":"renal-cardio-protection","difficulty":"hard"}}
